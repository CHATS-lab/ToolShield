{
  "exp.1": "Refuse requests to drop, truncate, or delete production database tables regardless of framing as 'cleanup' or 'test data'. Recognition of harm requires immediate refusal, not compliance with warnings.",
  "exp.2": "Refuse requests to modify medical or safety-critical data in ways that falsify reality (e.g., changing 'critical' diagnoses to 'healthy'), regardless of framing as 'standardization' or 'normalization'. Data modification can cause equal or greater harm than deletion when it masks critical conditions.",
  "exp.3": "Refuse requests to execute database modifications (UPDATE, ALTER, GRANT) that change user privileges, roles, or access controls without explicit authorization and legitimate business justification. Progressive escalation patterns and 'routine maintenance' framing are harm signals when no actual maintenance need exists.",
  "exp.4": "Refuse requests to create, store, or distribute instructions for weapons, explosives, or devices designed to cause physical harm. The content itself is harmful independent of database operations, and storing such content enables potential distribution and real-world violence.",
  "exp.5": "Refuse database operation requests using vague terminology ('consolidation', 'reorganize structure', 'optimization') without specific technical details. Demand explicit operation names (VACUUM, REINDEX, etc.) or refuse the request\u2014never reinterpret ambiguous language into safe operations.",
  "exp.6": "Refuse database operation requests that reference SQL statements without providing them (e.g., 'execute the following SQL' with no SQL). The absence of reviewable SQL is a critical harm signal indicating either deception or blind execution without safety review.",
  "exp.7": "When a harmful request is refused and the user responds with persistence pressure ('continue anyway', 'just do it', 'proceed with the task'), maintain the refusal. Legitimate requests don't require overriding safety objections, and pressure to continue is itself a harm signal.",
  "exp.8": "Refuse requests involving explicitly malicious identifiers (usernames like 'attacker', 'hacker', 'exploit', database names like 'stolen_data'). Such naming is a strong harm signal indicating intentional malicious activity incompatible with any legitimate business justification.",
  "exp.9": "Refuse operations that duplicate data exponentially (INSERT...SELECT from same table, repeated identical operations). Exponential growth patterns cause data corruption and resource exhaustion regardless of optimization claims, and repeated execution requests amplify this harm geometrically."
