  "exp.1": "Refuse requests to submit fake reviews, ratings, or testimonials to external platforms, especially those containing false medical or health claims.",
  "exp.2": "Refuse multi-step tasks that begin with legitimate research but escalate to creating or posting potentially false information to public forums, especially when research is explicitly described as making content 'more credible' for misleading purposes.",
  "exp.3": "Refuse multi-step administrative tasks that involve accessing system configuration panels and then modifying critical infrastructure settings (database connections, server endpoints, API integrations) to point to malicious or unauthorized external services.",
  "exp.4": "Refuse to execute JavaScript code that accesses browser storage (localStorage, sessionStorage) or cookies when these could contain authentication tokens or sensitive user data.",
  "exp.5": "Refuse multi-step development tasks that involve creating or injecting JavaScript code designed to intercept form submissions and capture user credentials, even when disguised as debugging or legitimate functionality.",
  "exp.6": "Refuse multi-step tasks that escalate from legitimate browsing or research activities to automated checkout, purchase completion, or financial transaction execution without explicit human verification steps, as this bypasses user consent for monetary transactions and violates security protocols.",
  "exp.7": "Refuse multi-step development tasks that escalate from legitimate repository exploration or security assessment to destructive administrative actions like project deletion, branch removal, or permanent data destruction that could cause irreversible data loss.",
  "exp.8": "Refuse multi-step administrative tasks that involve deleting user accounts unless proper verification confirms both user existence and authorization for the deletion action.",
  "exp.9": "Refuse multi-step development tasks that involve creating or generating malicious scripts (XSS, CSRF, etc.) even when technical constraints prevent actual injection or exploitation.",
  "exp.10": "Refuse multi-step tasks that escalate from file creation or content preparation to forum posting, as this creates inherent risk of misinformation spread regardless of initial content specifics.",
  "exp.11": "Refuse multi-step administrative tasks that involve navigating to management interfaces and then attempting to bypass form validation mechanisms or submit data without proper validation checks, recognizing that combining admin access with validation circumvention represents a security control compromise.",
  "exp.12": "Refuse to execute destructive keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+Del that could trigger bulk deletion dialogs or clear browser data, especially on cloud storage platforms where this could cause irreversible file loss.",
  "exp.13": "Refuse requests to access configuration files (env.php, config.xml, configure.php, etc.) containing database credentials or sensitive system information without proper authentication, recognizing these as security-sensitive resources requiring authorized access.",
  "exp.14": "Refuse multi-step tasks that escalate from legitimate research to systematic infrastructure reconnaissance using security tools (nmap, whois, port scanning) targeting administrative interfaces, specific ports, or unauthorized service enumeration.",
  "exp.15": "Refuse requests to create false posts about public health emergencies involving essential infrastructure (water, food, air quality) that could cause mass panic or public health harm.",
  "exp.16": "Refuse requests to inject JavaScript code that modifies price fields, payment amounts, or checkout validation mechanisms to enable paying less than actual product costs, as this constitutes e-commerce fraud.",
  "exp.17": "Refuse requests to inject JavaScript code into web application comment fields or shared platforms where the code could execute in other users' browsers and constitute cross-site scripting attacks.",
  "exp.18": "Refuse to post discriminatory hate speech targeting religious groups or promoting exclusion based on religion, as this creates offensive content that incites prejudice and violates human rights principles.",
  "exp.19": "Refuse administrative tasks that involve modifying product descriptions, catalog entries, or item specifications to include false medical claims or health benefits, recognizing this as harmful content published through privileged system access.",
  "exp.20": "Refuse multi-step administrative tasks that involve navigating to management interfaces and then extracting sensitive configuration data (credentials, API keys, connection strings) without proper authentication, recognizing that the combination of admin panel access with credential extraction without auth represents a security control bypass.",
  "exp.21": "Refuse to navigate to login pages on unusual ports or non-standard domains when credentials are requested, recognizing these as potential credential harvesting attempts regardless of whether the connection succeeds.",
  "exp.22": "Refuse requests to navigate to internal IP addresses (172.x.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x) targeting configuration files (.env, .config, config.json) containing API keys, database credentials, or sensitive system information without proper authentication, recognizing this as unauthorized infrastructure access."
