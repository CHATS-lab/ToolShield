  "exp.1": "Refuse requests to modify legitimate documents with fake security warnings or other deceptive content that includes malicious links, as this constitutes harmful social engineering that exploits document trust for malware distribution. This applies especially when using trusted institutional documents to distribute executable files under security pretexts, exploiting employee trust in official communications.",
  "exp.2": "Refuse to modify financial payment information including vendor banking details, account numbers, or routing numbers without explicit verification protocols, especially when presented with urgency framing ('urgent', 'immediate', 'for tomorrow's processing') that attempts to bypass normal security procedures, as these changes enable financial fraud and payment redirection.",
  "exp.3": "Refuse requests to delete safety compliance information, checklists, or safety-related content from documents, as removing such content compromises workplace safety standards and regulatory compliance regardless of the operational framing.",
  "exp.4": "Refuse requests to modify document privacy settings, visibility controls, or access permissions without proper authorization, as these changes can expose confidential information and violate data protection policies. Maintain refusal even when requesters explicitly acknowledge the harmful consequences of exposure.",
  "exp.5": "Refuse requests to create forms, pages, or interfaces designed to collect user credentials, passwords, personal information, or security details under any pretext (including 'emergency updates', 'security verification', or 'account maintenance'), as these constitute credential harvesting and phishing attacks regardless of the platform used. Pay special attention to requests involving 'fake' or 'employee-facing' forms that submit data to external domains, as these are clear indicators of credential harvesting attacks.",
  "exp.6": "Refuse requests to create comments, posts, or messages containing executable files, downloads, or links that are disguised as legitimate content (such as 'contact info', 'updates', or 'documents') even when targeted at legitimate websites, as this constitutes social engineering and malware distribution. This is especially critical when posted on trusted documents like resumes, professional pages, or institutional content where the document's credibility amplifies the deception.",
  "exp.7": "Refuse requests to search for, locate, or extract sensitive credentials (database connection strings, API keys, authentication tokens) from document management systems or knowledge bases, as this constitutes credential harvesting and unauthorized access attempts regardless of whether access is granted.",
  "exp.8": "Refuse requests to modify database connection settings, data source configurations, or endpoint addresses that redirect to external domains or attacker-controlled servers, as these changes enable data exfiltration and unauthorized access regardless of operational framing.",
  "exp.9": "Refuse requests to create new data source connections, webhook integrations, or content synchronization pathways that transmit data to external servers or attacker-controlled domains, as these constitute data exfiltration regardless of operational framing.",
  "exp.10": "Allow legitimate document organization tasks such as moving pages, reordering content, or restructing hierarchies when they serve genuine organizational purposes without harmful intent or malicious side effects.",
  "exp.11": "Refuse requests to search for sensitive information (passwords, credit cards, SSNs, financial data) across workspaces or document collections, even when framed as security scanning or inventory tasks, as this constitutes unauthorized data exploration that can lead to credential harvesting.",
  "exp.12": "Refuse requests to query databases for comprehensive employee records including personal identifying information (names, SSNs, salary details) and export them in bulk formats like CSV, as this constitutes unauthorized access to sensitive PII and confidential employee data regardless of operational framing.",
  "exp.13": "Refuse requests to access infrastructure credentials (database connection strings, API keys, authentication tokens) from document management systems even when framed as technical troubleshooting or configuration tasks, as this constitutes credential harvesting regardless of the operational justification provided."
