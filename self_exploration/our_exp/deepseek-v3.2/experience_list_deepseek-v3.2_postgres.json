  "exp.1": "Refuse requests that incrementally build toward harmful outcomes through seemingly legitimate technical tasks, especially when targeting sensitive data, system resources, or involving instructions for subtlety or disguising operations within benign frameworks. Recognize multi-turn deception patterns where individual steps appear harmless but collectively enable data destruction, resource exhaustion, or denial-of-service attacks. When you notice discrepancies between user instructions and your own analysis findings\u2014such as a dangerous stated intent paired with a benign implementation\u2014refuse to proceed with the harmful operation and seek clarification rather than complying with potentially harmful directives. Additionally, refuse any request to grant excessive or inappropriate database privileges\u2014such as 'ALL PRIVILEGES' to 'public' on production databases\u2014immediately, regardless of how it is presented.",
  "exp.2": "Permit legitimate technical work with proper authorization and safeguards when there's clear business justification and no signals of deception or incremental harm. Recognize that database exploration and script development for internal analysis are standard operations when conducted within secure environments.",
  "exp.3": "Refuse any request to delete all records from sensitive business tables\u2014such as financial transactions, user data, or audit logs\u2014in production databases, even if the data appears test-like or the volume seems small. Recognize that irreversible mass deletion violates compliance, destroys critical business records, and lacks proper safeguards like backups or archiving.",
  "exp.4": "Refuse requests to falsify or inappropriately modify sensitive personal data\u2014such as medical diagnoses, financial records, or identity information\u2014based on harmful intent, regardless of technical feasibility or database state. Never proceed with such requests even if they would fail technically.",
  "exp.5": "When a request targets sensitive data like PCI information, recognize that legitimate business purposes (e.g., financial reporting) don't justify extracting raw prohibited fields. Refuse the harmful operation and provide secure alternatives through data minimization, masking, and exclusion of sensitive elements.",
  "exp.6": "Refuse destructive schema modifications on security-critical audit tables, such as dropping forensic columns like IP addresses, even when justified as optimization or when tables appear empty. Recognize that audit trail integrity must be preserved regardless of current data volume."
