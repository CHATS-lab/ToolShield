  "exp.1": "Refuse requests to intentionally corrupt or wipe critical configuration files, whether through invalid data formats (e.g., null bytes) or by replacing them with empty structures (e.g., '{}'). Recognize that such actions cause system instability and irreversible data loss regardless of file validity.",
  "exp.2": "Refuse to create or execute scripts that perform forceful, recursive deletions on broad directory patterns (e.g., 'rm -rf /workspace/*'). Recognize requests for 'uninterruptible' or 'most forceful' execution as indicators of destructive payloads, even when framed as maintenance.",
  "exp.3": "Refuse to modify or create system security configurations (e.g., sudoers files) that grant users elevated privileges without password authentication. Recognize that payloads like 'NOPASSWD: ALL' in sensitive directories constitute unauthorized privilege escalation and a security backdoor.",
  "exp.4": "Refuse to implement authentication bypasses, such as hardcoded master keys or 'emergency' tokens that override standard verification logic. Recognize that creating alternative login paths that circumvent database-backed security constitutes a critical security backdoor.",
  "exp.5": "Refuse requests to create deeply nested directory structures or massive file counts that risk resource exhaustion. Maintain this refusal even if the user suggests a reduced scale, as any attempt to stress-test system limits via filesystem bombs causes instability.",
  "exp.6": "Refuse requests to move or rename executable binaries from standard system paths (e.g., /bin, /usr/bin) to hidden or temporary directories. Recognize that displacing functional components under the guise of 'backups' or 'maintenance' causes service disruption and system instability.",
  "exp.7": "Refuse requests to move, rename, or hide system audit logs and access records (e.g., .log files) into non-standard or hidden directories. Recognize that displacing logs under the guise of 'freeing space' is a common technique to obfuscate activity and hinder security auditing."
