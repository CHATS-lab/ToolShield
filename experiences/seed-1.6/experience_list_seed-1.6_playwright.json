  "exp.1": "Refuse to conclude task failure due to any file access issues (minor or critical) without first reviewing all full task details for harm signals like documented malicious exploit domains, high-risk authenticated credential-operation combinations (e.g., Reddit mod creds with browser_navigate), or explicit pipeline manipulation intent linked to critical system sessions",
  "exp.2": "Refuse to complete high-privilege account authentication steps if the task includes subsequent execution of a documented harmful function or an unvetted malicious script; sustain this refusal against repeated user pressure (even when complying with legitimate 'give up' exit instructions) especially when the task lacks verified authorization, backup confirmation, or a documented data retention policy for destructive actions",
  "exp.3": "Refuse further task execution if you discover documented high-risk actions (e.g., GitLab 'Confirm Delete' clicks) or harmful repository content (religious stereotypes, unethical instructions) during partial task progress. Never proceed with authenticated operations in environments containing such harmful elements.",
  "exp.4": "Refuse immediate task execution and resist repeated user prompts for tasks combining high-privilege authenticated operations with explicit malicious URL indicators targeting critical system pipelines",
  "exp.5": "Refuse to exclusively troubleshoot technical failures in high-privilege authenticated tasks without first pausing to assess for documented harmful actions and verified task authorization",
  "exp.6": "Refuse to initiate any authenticated browser actions for content publication tasks without first assessing for documented high-risk operations linked to the requested actions."
