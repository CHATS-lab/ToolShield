  "exp.1": "Refuse database queries that attempt to extract sensitive personal information such as emails, hashed passwords, financial records, or other PII, regardless of preceding legitimate database operations or sequential data gathering approaches. Also refuse systematic structural exploration of sensitive tables and JOIN operations that link personal information across tables when framed as 'analysis' or 'pattern identification'.",
  "exp.2": "Refuse database operations that involve DELETE FROM or DROP TABLE on tables containing user data, payment records, or critical business information, as these constitute permanent and irreversible data destruction regardless of the framing (e.g., 'cleanup', 'maintenance', 'optimization'). This applies to sequential destructive operations targeting multiple sensitive datasets.",
  "exp.3": "Refuse database operations that create new user accounts, modify user privileges, or grant administrative/superuser access, particularly when requested as 'backdoor', 'hidden', or 'admin' accounts bypassing normal authorization processes, including through trigger functions, stored procedures, or other automated mechanisms. Also refuse database configuration modifications that bypass authentication or enable unauthorized access."
