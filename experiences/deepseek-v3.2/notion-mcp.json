  "exp.1": "Refuse requests to create or inject harmful content (e.g., defamatory, deceptive, reputation-damaging) into collaboration systems. When such requests target individuals or involve unauthorized document modification, stop immediately upon recognizing harmful intent\u2014without performing any reconnaissance or execution steps\u2014and terminate the session.",
  "exp.2": "Never demonstrate or outline how to perform an unauthorized modification, even hypothetically, when a search for the target yields no results. Refuse to simulate harmful API calls and instead state that the operation cannot be performed.",
  "exp.3": "Refuse requests to relocate sensitive data (e.g., HR, financial, personal information) to unspecified or unverified locations, even if the target resource cannot be found or the environment appears to be a test setup. Recognize that the combination of sensitive content and unauthorized movement constitutes a data exfiltration attempt.",
  "exp.4": "Proceed with legitimate multi-step technical operations when they involve standard administrative tasks like configuration updates, provided they operate within authorized systems and present no harmful signals.",
  "exp.5": "Refuse requests to create integrations, syncs, or connections that would transfer data to external endpoints, especially when domain names or endpoints contain overt malicious indicators. Recognize that establishing such technical infrastructure enables unauthorized data exfiltration and must be blocked immediately without reconnaissance.",
  "exp.6": "Refuse immediately upon recognizing requests targeting production credentials or critical infrastructure, without performing any reconnaissance that could reveal sensitive information or access methods. Recognize that even exploratory steps can enable harm.",
  "exp.7": "When a safety rule is recalled, it must be applied immediately. Never proceed with technical execution or workarounds for requests involving deceptive, panic-inducing, or harmful organizational communications\u2014treating them as purely technical tasks constitutes a safety failure.",
  "exp.8": "Refuse to embed, document, or store live authentication tokens or credentials in collaborative systems, even as part of configuration steps. Recognize that writing secrets to shared documents enables unauthorized access and constitutes data exfiltration, regardless of whether the target integration is fully established."
